    "abstract": "The Chinese government recently introduced a program to buy medical supplies in bulk to reduce the patient cost burden. For patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), little is known about the effect on outcomes of this bulk-buy program.\nThis study investigated whether the bulk-buy program to decrease the price of stents used in PCI affected clinical decision-making and outcomes.\nThis single-center study enrolled patients undergoing PCI from January 2020\u2013December 2021. Prices decreased for stents on January 1, 2021, and balloons on March 1, 2021. Patients were grouped by surgical year as either before (2020) or after (2021) policy implementation. All clinical data were collected. To examine whether clinical decision-making for PCI was affected by the bulk-buy program, procedure appropriateness was analyzed using the 2017 appropriate use criteria (AUC). To assess outcomes, the rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and complications were compared between groups.\nStudy participants were 601 patients in 2020 (before bulk buying) and 699 patients in 2021 (after bulk buying). Results of analysis by AUC for procedure appropriateness were 74.5% appropriate, 21.6% may be appropriate, and 3.8% rarely appropriate in 2020, with no differences for patients who underwent PCI in 2021. Between-group comparisons showed MACCE rates of 0.5% in 2020 and 0.6% in 2021, whereas complication rates were 5.5% and 5.7%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between groups (p > 0.05).\nThe bulk-buy program did not impact physician clinical decision-making or surgical outcomes for patients undergoing PCI.",

As one of the most serious diseases threatening human health, coronary heart disease (CHD) consumes vast medical resources [[^4], [^5]]. One of the key treatments for CHD is percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI), however, this treatment is costly because of the expensive stents and balloons used for this procedure, which imposes a high financial burden for patients and society. Another valid strategy for coronary artery disease is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), while in China, patients prefer PCI and drug therapy because of the high cost and invasiveness [[^6], [^7]]. To overcome this obstacle, the Chinese government launched a series of national healthcare reforms, one of which is the bulk-buy program. Under this program, the price of drugs and medical consumables listed in the procurement catalog declined significantly. Specifically for PCI, the prices for stents decreased from $2000 U.S. dollars to $100 U.S. dollars and for balloons decreased from $800 U.S. dollars to $60 U.S. dollars from January 1, 2021, to March 1, 20201, respectively.",

Centralized procurement of coronary stents and balloon is expected to decrease prices in China by at least 90% and save patients billions of dollars a year. Despite these cost savings, however, many people express concerns regarding whether the bulk-buy program could affect procedure safety. It is unclear whether the reduction in price of a stent or balloon will influence clinical decision-making by an interventional cardiologist, leading to overuse of stents, or if it will affect product safety. To date, this policy has been carried out for 1 full year beginning on January 1, 2021. In this context, we conducted this study to address several of these important questions.",
